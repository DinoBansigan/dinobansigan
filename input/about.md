Title: About Me
---
Hey there, my name is **Dino Bansigan**. 

I am a .NET Software Developer currently working for a financial company in the DFW area. I enjoy working with C# and SQL Server. I love writing code that talks to the database and vice versa.

I have this mindset that I will forever be a student of software development. There is always something new for me to learn, some new way for me to improve my craft. I look at writing code as an art form. I think solving problems by writing clean, beautiful code is very much like painting a masterpiece. I won't always end up with a masterpiece, but I like to take pride in my code. I think every developer should take pride in their code.

### About This Blog

On this blog I plan to write mainly about software development, my experiences as a .NET software developer and other random topics that interests me. My aim is to keep my blog posts short and simple. They should not take more than 10 minutes to read and the reader should be able to learn something from it. 

### More Information

When I'm not writing code, I spend most of my time with my family. I love going on roadtrips and doing bike rides with my wife and our energetic toddler. I enjoy playing board games and video games with my wife. I love reading books and listening to rock music.
