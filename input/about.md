Title: About Me
---
Hey there, my name is **Dino Bansigan**. 

I am a .NET Software Developer currently working for a financial company in the DFW area. I enjoy working with C# and SQL Server. I love writing code that talks to the database and vice versa.

When I'm not writing code, I spend most of my time with my family. I love going on roadtrips and doing bike rides with my wife and our energetic toddler. I enjoy playing board games and video games with my wife. I love reading books and listening to rock music.

### About This Blog

On this blog I plan to write about my experiences as a .NET software developer and other topics that interest me outside of work. My aim is to keep my blog posts short and simple. They should not take more than 10 minutes to read and the reader should be able to learn something from it.
