                Welcome to my personal home on the web. I am a .NET Software Developer currently working in the DFW area. When I'm not writing code, I like to spend time with 
                my family. I've been blessed with a beautiful wife and two kids. In my spare time I like to read books, listen to rock music, play video games, write on my 
                journal and well... write code.
            </p>

                That said, you can still find my old dev blog posts <a href="/latestposts">here</a>. 
                If you were looking for my other websites, then we can sort that out too. I have the aforementioned <a href="https://journal.dinobansigan.com">personal journal</a>, a <a href="https://nowlisteningto.com">music blog</a>
