The most convenient way it seems to get .NET Core 3.0 installed on a Windows PC, is to download the free [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). Installing Visual Studio 2019 will also install .NET Core 3.0 and after the installation is done, you can start playing around with it.

If you want to download the SDK or just the runtime separately, you can find them [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).

To check if you already have .NET Core 3.0 installed, you can pull up a Command Prompt and run the `dotnet --version` command.

Lastly, if you're trying to learn ASP.NET Core like I am, this [recommended learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-3.0#recommended-learning-path) seems to be a good starting point.
