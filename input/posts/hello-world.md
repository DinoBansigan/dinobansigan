This has been a long time coming. I have talked about making my own website/blog for years... and I mean years. Just ask my wife, who is probably tired of hearing me talk about it. Well I finally got a website up and running. 

This is a static site built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted for free on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)! All I had to do was fork a [repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on Github, make some configuration changes and here we are. While not as straightforward as creating a Wordpress blog, it is an interesting path to take for a software developer. 

I will talk more about how this website was created in a future post.

**Update: I have since updated my blog to being generated using [Wyam](https://wyam.io).**
