Title: Making an Effort to Read More Books
Lead: 2018 was the year that I really made an effort to start reading more books when I was at home. The reason for doing so came from an unexpected place; I wanted to be a better dad to my son.

It started when my wife reprimanded me for being on my phone too much when I was around my son. Whenever my son was taking a bath, I would be in the bathroom watching over him, except I was looking at my phone most of the time. Whenever my son was playing in the living room, I would be there watching him, except I was mostly checking Facebook and Instagram on my phone. I have seen the glances my son threw at me, expecting me to praise him for something new he has learned or done, except I was too focused on my phone to acknowledge him. 

Of course every parent knows that watching a child play can be really boring. Your kid won't be needing your attention all the time while they play. (This is why you see most parents glued to their phones when they are around their kids. I don't blame them.) However every so often, they will look at you and expect you to acknowledge them. When you do, you get rewarded with the cutest face you will ever see and is in my opinion, one of the best things about being a parent to a young one. When you don't acknowledge them, they will eventually go on playing, but for some reason, even if they don't show it, I feel that it makes them a litle sad to not get acknowledged.

My son is not old enough to ask me what's so important on my phone that I keep looking at it when I'm around him. Still I feel guilty whenever I fail to acknowledge him because I was using my phone. I felt like I was being a bad parent to my son. I was there, with him, trying to spend time with him, but at the same I really wasn't. I was consumed by whatever it was I was looking at on my phone. 

The truth is, I was addicted to social media and my phone. If I wasn't checking Facebook or Instagram, I was browsing the web on my phone checking the latest board games and video games. My addiction to social media and my smartphone was affecting the way I interacted and spent time with my son. This had to change. I needed to find something more productive to do instead of mindlessly wasting my time on my phone.

The answer for me was reading books. Nowadays whenever I am watching my son play, I make an effort to be reading a book instead of using my phone. Even when following him around on his balance bike (indoors), I'm trying to read a book. I found that reading a book doesn't exactly take all my attention away from my son, as opposed to using my phone. I also found that my renewed interest in reading books, has rubbed off on my son. He is now less interested in his iPad and is more interested in his books. He cannot read yet as he is only 2 years old (almost 3), so he is making me and my wife read to him. However I consider that a big improvement over him spending his time glued to his iPad.

I have a book in the living room and the bedroom. I'm currently reading Ready Player One whenever my son is playing out in the living room. I'm reading A Game of Thrones in the bedroom. I also have a book right in front of me at work, though I find it hard to find time to read that much at work, especially when there's so much coding to be done. Either way, when I have some free time during my lunch break, I try to read the Patterns, Principles and Practices of Domain-Driven Design book.

I only really started making an effort to read books back in August 2018. For 2018, I finished reading 4 books and have listed them below.
   - The Legend of Drizzt by R.A. Salvatorre
      - This was a great book, especially for fans of dungeons and dragons. I've heard of Drizzt before in other books, but never really knew his story. 
   - The Prince of Thorns by Mark Lawrence
      - Bought this book purely because of the cover art. Nearly returned it because I could not side with the protagonist at the start of the book. It is a dark visceral book,  however I stuck with it because the writing was very good. This turned out to be a very good book and one that I think fans of war tactics/strategies would appreciate.
   - Origins by Dan Brown
      - I am a big of Dan Brown's books. I don't think I've ever read a book that he wrote that I didn't like. This one was no different. A very thought provoking and entertaining read. Easily the best book I read in a long time. The icing on the cake is that the book gives you a virtual tour of Spain. All of the places mentioned in the book are real and they are as amazing as they were described in the book.
   - The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko
      - This was an eye-opener and a great book for those interested in personal finance. This book doesn't exactly tell you what to do to get your personal finances in order. What it does is tell you how regular people live their lives and the decisions they made which allowed them to become millionaires.


My aim is to increase the number of books I will be reading for 2019 and to add more self-development books to the list. As you might notice from the books I read in 2018 and the books I'm reading now, they mostly fall in either fantasy or fiction genre. This is not to say that there are no benefits to reading books in those genres. If you do a quick search online regarding the benefits of reading a book, you will find many reasons that can convince you to start reading more.

They say that you only have [940 Saturdays](https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/childhood-940-saturdays-and-youre-done/), from the moment your child is born, up to the time they turn 18. Think about that for a minute. You only get to spend 940 weeks at most with your child, before they turn 18, at which point you probably won't see them every other weekend. Heck, you probably won't even get to see them every other month. You most likely won't get to spend all 940 weeks with them anyway while they grow up.
