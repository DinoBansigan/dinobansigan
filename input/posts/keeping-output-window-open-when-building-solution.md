Ever since upgrading to Visual Studio 2017, I was always annoyed that it no longer defaulted to opening the Output window whenever I start building the solution. If I remember correctly, opening the Output window or making it visible was the default behavior in Visual Studio 2013 and 2015. So with VS 2017 I've always had to manually open the Output window during or after a build to see the output summary. Turns out the fix for this is a very simple setting in Visual Studio (duh). This saves me a good number of mouse clicks in a day :)
