If you are a software developer, this is probably the quickest and most fun way to get a blog up and running in like 5 minutes.
If you are not a developer and don't have time to tinker with your blog. I think you might be better off creating a blog using a CMS like 
Wordpress. At the very least, you would need to learn how to write content using 
[Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) if you are going to follow this approach to 
creating and maintaining your blog. *(Markdown is very easy to learn though even for non developers.)*

Regardless of whether you are a developer or not, this approach is pretty easy to follow and you will end up with a simple blog that just 
works. You don't even need a custom domain to try this out and your blog will be hosted for free on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). *This is how this blog/site was previously created. I have since updated this blog to be generated using [Wyam](https://wyam.io).*

There are a number of articles/posts about this topic already so I won't rehash what others have already written. I'll keep this short 
and simple and just point you to where you need to go to get this done.

1. Sign up for a [Github](https://github.com/) account. 
2. Find the [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repository on Github and start reading the readme info. Actually, you 
can jump straight to the [Quick Start section](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now#quick-start) and follow the instructions there.
3. That's pretty much it actually. If you follow Step 2 and go through the instructions from the Quick Start section, the end result is 
your very own blog up and running on the web, hosted on Github Pages for free!

Barry Clark, the creator of the Jekyll Now repository also wrote a more detailed tutorial on how to [create a blog using Jekyll Now and Github 
pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). If you made it this far, I suggest reading that as well.

There are some limitations to creating a blog using this approach, namely, your blog will not have an Archive and Tags pages out of the 
box. Those are features that I think people would normally expect to be built-in on a blog website. It is not the case here, most likely 
due to the restrictions Github Pages has on Jekyll plugins. Fear not, as these are easy to add/implement yourself. I will cover adding an 
Archive and Tags page in a future post.

I hope this post has at least helped you get started on a blog. Good day everyone!
