A few days ago I heard an ad on TV that said something like, "people say less is more, but more is REALLY MORE!". Obviously the intent of that ad is to get you to spend more money to buy more stuff. We live in a world where people are judged by their material possessions. The narrative being, if you have more, then you are living a better life compared to everyone else around you. That is ridiculous. 

The older I get the more I really believe that less is more. [Dan Erickson](http://www.danerickson.net/) wrote a post about [focusing on the "less is more" mindset](http://www.danerickson.net/things-we-leave-out/). It is an absolutely wonderful read.

> <p>So often we want more. We have been trained to think more is better. More money. More stuff. More success. But this idea of getting and doing more often gets in the way of our goals.</p> - Dan Erickson
