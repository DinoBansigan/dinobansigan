Iris Classon wrote a good lengthy post about the history of .NET web development and how it all lead to the development of the .NET Core that we have today. As someone who doesn't get to work as much on the web dev side of things, this was a very informative read for me. I think it is a good read for any .NET developer, so check out her post by following the link below.
