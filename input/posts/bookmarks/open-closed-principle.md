Out of the 5 [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), the Open/Closed principle was the hardest one for me to grasp. This [post](https://code-maze.com/open-closed-principle/) from [Code Maze](https://code-maze.com/) explains it really well and the code examples were very helpful. This was a good read.

*Rather than writing my own post about it, I thought I would share this one instead. After all, as programmers we should avoid reinventing the wheel as much as possible. This is also my first post in a new "Bookmarks" category that I've added to this website. The plan is to use that new post category to share interesting articles that I've found online.*
