A little more than half a year ago, I decided to make an effort to read more books. My motivation for reading more books was to act as a role model for my son, *but that's a different story for another time.* I'm here to talk about the kind of books I've been reading and if they were a good use of my time. 

I finished reading 3 books back in 2018 (started actively tracking the books I read back in August 2018):
- [Homeland](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50027.Homeland?from_search=true) by R.A. Salvatore.
- [Prince of Thorns](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9579634-prince-of-thorns?from_search=true) by Mark Lawrence
- [Origin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32283133-origin?ac=1&from_search=true) by Dan Brown

I already finished another one this year; [Ready Player One](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one?from_search=true) by Ernest Cline. 

As you can tell from the books I've read so far, they mostly fall under the fiction or fantasy genre. While I certainly enjoy reading those types of books, I started wondering if I'm wasting my time on them. I was wondering if I should be reading non-fiction, educational or self-improvement books instead. Turns out they are not a waste of time, hooray! 

So I'm sharing a post I found (and I found a number of them, just Google it with Bing) that list down five reasons to read fiction books/novels. Here is a quote from that post that I found fascinating.

> <p>Fiction is exactly that â€“ a compilation of imaginations from authors that we, as readers, adopt and develop in our own minds. This is why when you see a movie, everyone sees the same thing that the director puts on the screen in front of you. However, with a book, our minds create our own visual interpretations that are never the same as someone else who reads the same exact book.</p>- Rugged Fellows Guide

*At the moment, I'm reading [The Shadow that was Lost](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22878967-the-shadow-of-what-was-lost) by James Islington. So far it has been a great book, that is really hard to put down.*
