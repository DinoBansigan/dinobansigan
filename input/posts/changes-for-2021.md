I started this dev blog back in [December 2018](https://dinobansigan.com/posts/hello-world). It initially started out as a [Jekyll Now blog](https://github.com/DinoBansigan/JekyllNowBlog) hosted on Github Pages. After about two weeks I made the [switch to a Wyam powered blog](https://dinobansigan.com/posts/migrating-blog-wyam). And it's been that way since then. 

This was my first real website. The first one that I bought a domain name for. Fast forward to 2021 and I now have 4 websites. There's this dev blog, my [personal journal](https://journal.dinobansigan.com/), my [music blog](https://nowlisteningto.com/) and a [photo-blog](https://ateas.dinobansigan.com/). At one point in 2020, I also had a microblog that has since been discontinued. So, in total, I had five websites.

After my second [digital declutter](https://write.as/dino/digital-declutter-rules-v2-0), I've come to the realization that five websites is one too many. I felt like I couldn't keep maintaining all five at once. Since then, I've been thinking about reducing the number of websites I maintained.

I've thought about combining this dev blog with my personal journal a few times in the past. What was holding me back every time, was that I wasn't sure it was a good idea to have one site that contained both professional and personal content. However, I was also keenly aware of the creeping exhaustion of maintaining multiple websites at once.

*There's also the fact that to publish content on this dev blog, I needed to do it on a machine that had .NET Core, Git and Visual Studio Code installed on it. On the other hand, to publish content on my personal journal, all I needed was a web browser.*

 So, in the interest of simplifying things for 2021, I've decided to stop publishing software development posts on this blog. I'm keeping the existing content on this blog for now. But new software development posts will now be published on my [personal journal](https://journal.dinobansigan.com/).

 I'm not sure if there are a lot of people who read this dev blog. If you are one of them though, I would like to invite you to check out my [personal journal](https://journal.dinobansigan.com/). And if that's something you don't want to do, that's okay too. In any case, thank you for reading this post and I hope you have a nice day!
